# MapDownloader

This is a Cross Platform Windows/Linux/MacOS application developed in Qt Widget which can be used for downloading tiles from openstreetmap.org or other webservers which support a request like [url]/zoom/tileX/tileY.png

In order to download the wanted tiles one has to set the zoom, latitude and longitude intervals between which the tiles are to be found.

There is also a setting which offers the possibility to start from a specific tile from the interval the user set.

"Check Downloaded Files" can be used to check if all the files for a specific configuration have been downloaded.
